# PyPI Cloud Plugin For User Auth Via Bitbucket Cloud
Making Bitbucket Cloud authentication accessible for custom PyPI Cloud.

This project is inspired by the NPM package [verdaccio-bitbucket](https://github.com/idangozlan/verdaccio-bitbucket
) which solves the same problem for the custom NPM repository [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/).

user via npm command line.
